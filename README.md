# Processing-Paint

My first Processing program.
A simple paint program made in Processing.

You can adjust the brush color using the RGB adjustment controls:
  
  • A/R/G/B  =  Select all/red/green/blue color to adjust.
  
  • ↑/↓  =  Change value of selected color.

The scroll wheel or left/right arrow keys can be used to adjust brush size.

Pressing the spacebar will clear the drawing and set the background to the selected color.

RGB values, a color display, the brush size, and the selected color to edit are shown along the bottom toolbar.
